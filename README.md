# LRP-on-Indian-Classical-Dance-Forms-Images
The project aims to utilize Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) under the XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) domain to generate heatmaps from a pre-trained VGG16 model on Indian classical dance images. These heatmaps will highlight the model's understanding of the dance forms.
Kindly create an empty folder named 'output' under the LYP_Main repository on downloading the code.
